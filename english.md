### Task 1

- Explain the task
- Clearly
- In practice
- Programming language
- Numbers combination
- To be divided
- General category
- Machine language
- Symbolic language
- Convinient
- Particular model of computer
- Data
- Specific
- Indirect address
- To modify the program
- To somplify the process

### Task 2

1. The computer - is not a human that you can to communicate. This is a machine that you can send instruction.
2. In a practice we use special programming languages. They are divided into three general categories, there are machine language, symbolic language, and automatic coding languages.
3. The instructions are explained by combinations of letters and numbers
4. The convinient programming language is a language that can be used for a few models of computers.
5. You can know all the programming language but you should to choose that languages that are convinient in use.


### Task 3

From: Iliash Kliuiev
To: Some abstract person


Hi! My name is Iliash and I want to tell you about the programming languages I use.

The most used PL is JavaScript. It's very convinient to use in several programming directions, starting of bringing interactive elements to a WEB page ending with creating scripts for microcontrollers like Arduino. I know this language better than others.

The second PL I use is Python. This is a script language similar to JavaScript, but using almost in scientific directions.

Another PL I know are C and C++. These are very hard languages to fully understand, but I have intermediate knowlage in them. Unlike previous languages, these are languages that compiles into a machine code before using, so these are the most low-level languages I know.

In general projects I use JavaScript and Python languages depends of the direction of the project.
