### Task 1

- Explain the task
- Clearly
- In practice
- Programming language
- Numbers combination
- To be divided
- General category
- Machine language
- Symbolic language
- Convinient
- Particular model of computer
- Data
- Specific
- Indirect address
- To modify the program
- To somplify the process

### Task 2

1. The computer - is not a human that you can to communicate. This is a machine that you can send instruction.
2. In a practice we use special programming languages. They are divided into three general categories, there are machine language, symbolic language, and automatic coding languages.
3. The instructions are explained by combinations of letters and numbers
4. The convinient programming language is a language that can be used for a few models of computers.
5. You can know all the programming language but you should to choose that languages that are convinient in use.


### Task 3

From: Iliash Kliuiev
To: Some abstract person


Hi! My name is Iliash and I want to tell you about the programming languages I use.

The most used PL is JavaScript. It's very convinient to use in several programming directions, starting of bringing interactive elements to a WEB page ending with creating scripts for microcontrollers like Arduino. I know this language better than others.

The second PL I use is Python. This is a script language similar to JavaScript, but using almost in scientific directions.

Another PL I know are C and C++. These are very hard languages to fully understand, but I have intermediate knowlage in them. Unlike previous languages, these are languages that compiles into a machine code before using, so these are the most low-level languages I know.

In general projects I use JavaScript and Python languages depends of the direction of the project.

- Page 130 `Type of High-level languages`
- Ex 3.29, 3.30, 3.31


### Ex 3.29

1. Developing in the house
2. In the sense that
3. to go about solving the problem
4. To facilitate easy access
5. They're called/termed nonprocedural languages
6. User interface
7. individual data item
8. to attain/accomplish goals
9. to solve the problem at hand
10. one-to-one correspondence
11. to move data into and out of the computer
12. to supervise the operation of hardware of machine
13. to monitor the use of various hardware
14. with less time and effort

### Ex 3.32

1. since they specify as a sequence of explicit commands how the machine is to go about solving the problem at hand.
2. Since LISP objects may be other functions as well as individual data items (variables, in mathematical terminology) or data structures
3. In the sense that the programmer specifies what goals are to be accomplished but not how specefic methods are to be applied to attain those goals.
4. designed for performing tasksuch as comntrolling all operations required to move data into and out of the computer.
5. that they are easy to learn and use
6. monitors the use of various hardware like memory, CPU etc.
7. and it requires extensive knowlege of computer technology.
8. supervise the operation of the entire system including controlling the execution of all other software and diagnosing faults.
9. An operating system provides simple, efficient, and reliable means
10. has almost a one-to-one correspondence to a machine instruction in the machine code.
11. An interpreter is another type of program translator.
12. performing frequently required everyday tasks.
