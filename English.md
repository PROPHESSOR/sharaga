Homework:
```
Dear Teacher,
I'm fine and I hope that you fell the same.
In this English lesson we're writing a letter and I'm writing the letter for you.
It's a good practice for me.

I've classes in Zhytomyr State Polytechnical University to the group IPZk-20-1.
I'm in a class with six students, they're our subgroup.
They're all from different cities but almost from Zhytomyr.

I don't have time after univercity to make homeworks so I make them during breaks.
