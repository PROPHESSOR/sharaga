Dear Teacher,
I'm fine and I hope that you fell the same.
In this English lesson we're writing a letter and I'm writing the letter for you.
It's a good practice for me.

I've classes in Zhytomyr State Polytechnical University to the group IPZk-20-1.
I'm in a class with six students, they're our subgroup.
They're all from different cities but almost from Zhytomyr.

I don't have time after university to make homeworks so I make them during breaks.

Dear teacher,
How are you? I’m fine. I would like to tell you about my mom.
She’s in her early fifties, but she’s still quite young in spirit.
She has a fair complexion, thick brown hair and light brown eyes.
She has a kind face, and when you meet her, the first thing you notice is her lovely, warm smile.
She likes watching movies, drawing pictures and going for long walks over the hills.
Also she is very good at cooking and she is clever with her hands.
I'm deeply attached to her.
See ya next lesson

From what do you usually start your day?
The most important asset and resource in your life

```
I usually start my day with waking up.
The most important resource for me is a clarity of mind.
Do get it I need to wake up half an hour before work starts.
Usually it's a hard challenge because I'm going sleep around 2AM.

10 productive habbits:
- Brain dump
- Make down your TODO List
- Write down Intentions
- Shcedule
- Plan meals
- Plan content
- Go over financies
- Catch up on messanging people
- Make time for self-care

I always make TODO lists because nowadays is very hard to keep everything in mind, so in that way I can reduce tension on my mind.
Although I make schedule to make easier planning of meetings, activities and events.
Planning content makes me easy to create regular publishing.

Rest:
- Physical
- Mental
- Sensory
- Creative
- Emotional
- Social
- Spiritual


> Mental rest is very important for me because of mental pressure I get everything on work, university and projects.

> And usually all the day I have physical rest whey lying on the bed.
